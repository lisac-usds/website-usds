<h4>In this series you’ll hear stories from USDSers and learn why they decided to join, why they stay, and how their work is making an impact for all Americans.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/791/1*0Nu9O39FzFsAzkKFua3BSA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Carla at her desk during the recent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17862337975640355/">DHS team Instagram takeover</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Carla Bynum (she/her), Executive Assistant, USDS @ Department of Homeland Security. Previously, U.S. General Services Administration. From Washington, D.C.</strong></p><p><strong>What’s your background?</strong></p><p>Prior to joining the USDS at DHS team, I provided administrative support for various offices within the General Services Administration. Nine years ago, I started out supporting the GSA American Recovery Act office where I worked in the Limited Scopes office. I spent a bulk of my time with GSA supporting their Field Office and Opportunities Center at St. Elizabeths campus where we provided workforce development opportunities to residents in Ward 8. I then moved to the GSA maintenance office at the Nebraska Avenue Complex.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to join USDS?</strong></p><p>Community-service has always been a passion of mine and I was heavily involved in community service and outreach efforts at my previous job. I was attracted to USDS because of the focus on people-centered development.</p><blockquote>I love that USDS is intentional about selecting projects and is dedicated to helping underrepresented communities, such as <a href="https://www.usds.gov/projects/discharge-upgrade-tool">veterans</a> and <a href="https://www.usds.gov/projects/n-400">immigrants</a>.</blockquote><p><strong>What will you miss most about USDS when you leave?</strong></p><p>I will miss the family vibe USDS has. Everyone that I’ve interacted with has been super friendly and work to actively counteract stereotypes we often encounter around public servants.</p><p><strong>What do you want to do after USDS?</strong></p><p>I would love to continue working on people-centered projects that benefit communities that are oftentimes overlooked.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/304/0*4q8UIuzrrKfKHiWR.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>The best of technology.<br>The best of government.<br>And we want you.</strong><br>We’re looking for the most tenacious designers, software engineers, product managers, and more, who are committed to untangling, rewiring and redesigning critical government services.
