<h4>A series of stories from recent USDS hires on starting from home.</h4><p><strong>By: John Hashimoto, USDS at </strong><a href="https://www.usds.gov/projects/discharge-upgrade-tool"><strong>VA</strong></a></p><p><em>1 of 4 articles in this series.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/646/1*pa_q851JJhq7Zq70MJ72IA.png" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href="https://www.talenthouse.com/item/2286356/edd709f7">Glenn D’Hondt</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Let your coworkers be your guide</strong></p><p>Collaboration tools like Slack are an indispensable tool in The New Normal. But don’t make the mistake I made: my first request when joining the VA team in March was “tell me which Slack channels to join to get up to speed.” Within two days, I was drowning in conversations — many without context. What was the signal, what was the noise?</p><blockquote>No doubt: Slack overload is in a neck-to-neck competition with Zoom fatigue. What to do?</blockquote><p>For one, don’t turn on the firehose. Ask a peer or two this question: What are the top five Slack channels — in rank order — that will help me get my job done and make me wiser about the culture, the team norms and express myself more fully.</p><p>My recommendation: Slack in moderation to start. Then, as your channel list inevitably grows, practice good remote hygiene by muting or leaving a few every week.</p><p>Keep your “Starred” list to the precious few channels that really matter. You’ll thank yourself for your ruthless discipline.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/778/1*4r255XGJyAENyo-eO0vVWQ.png" /></figure><p><em>Tips from some of the </em><a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/meet-the-team-spring-2020-bbb6034e2c"><em>USDS Spring 2020 Cohort</em></a><em> on starting at USDS in an all-remote world.</em></p><p>In the midst of a pandemic, we’re very privileged:</p><ol><li>To have a job at all in this environment</li><li>To be able to start and continue my work from home</li><li>And to have an amazing welcome from coworkers at USDS and our partner agencies</li></ol><p>We’re not experts at teleworking, but now that we’ve been on the job for ~100 days, we wanted to share tips from our experience in case you find yourself in a similar situation.
